Final Project - The Connected History
-------------------------------------

"_Ideas don't come from people, ideas come from conversations_."

The final project consists of two parts, the project itself and a presentation.

For this project, students are asked to map a historical social network and explore how it formed or shaped ideas. This can be approached from looking at a historical social network (e.g. the Vienna Circle), picking an event (e.g. the Chicago World's Fair â€” see student sample below), picking a project (e.g. the Manhattan Project - see student sample below), or an idea or movement (e.g. racial integration or the civil rights movement.) These are not the only way to approach the project, merely several ideas.
